                <h4>Glacier National Park has to be one of the most beautiful places in the US. Just <em>look</em> at this place. We've all been before, when I got back from my Mission. Personally I've wanted to go back ever since the moment we left. It felt to me like there were another hundred more beautiful hikes to walk. We could also do a bit of Kayaking in the mountain lakes.</h4>

                <h4>As far as I can tell, there really isn't much else to do at and around Glacier. That said I'm drawn to say "why would you want to do anything but spend every spare moment wandering around it's beautiful forests!" Of course, if we're really attached to eating delcious food or spending many long happy hours playing Board games, perhaps Glacier isn't the right choice.</h4>
