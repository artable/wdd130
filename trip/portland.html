                <h4>Portland has one strict advantage over Most any other choice for a vacation spot: Carrie lives there. This eases the burden of travel for us, and gives us a lot of insight into what activities we're going to enjoy the most. Portland is definitely a city though. Perhaps this is a bit self-evident, but I do feel there's a loss worth mentioning when you move away from the fresh clean air a place like Glacier can offer.<br><br>Portland sure is packed to the brim with stuff to do though. I know it's been a long time since I had decent seafood, I'm sure at least some of you feel the same way. There's an observatory, several museums, and a significant amount of natural beauty in the surrounding area; including the ocean, and beautiful curated gardens.</h4>
