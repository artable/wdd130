                <h4>Us siblings really need to get together at some point. It's been much too long since we all saw each other. Certainly none of our homes can house all of us (Y'all have way too many cats between you) So I've compiled a couple of options for places we can go. It is a bit difficult to find a place we would all be very excited to go, and which would fall within a reasonable budget. That said, I'm not overly concerned with the price of our stay; travel expenses will very likely be what makes this get together difficult.<br>In other words, we won't be headed to New York.<br><br>I've prepared what I feel are extremes as far as what recreational options will be available to us on any given trip. Perhaps there are cities other than Portland we'd rather visit, or parks other than Glacier we'd like to hike. I do think that these options give us a solid sense of what options are available to us though.</h4>
